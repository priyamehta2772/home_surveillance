Collecting Dataset Images

Necessary objects that make outline of a room:
Door (Many types)
Window (Many types)
Floor
. Staircase
. Elevator

Not including Wall and Roof for now in the dataset as they are part of background.
But to detect walking space and area of room, floor is important so including that in the dataset.

Secondary objects (all of many types):
. AC
. Table/Desk
. Chair
. Cupboard/Almirah
. Sofa
. Bed
. Fan
Tubelight -> difficult as it is white
Bulb
Plugs
